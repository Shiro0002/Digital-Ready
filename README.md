We created a colorama file that would be able to change the colors of the different card suits in our program. The card deck is always getting shuffled so that there is always a random order. Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game where players aim to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Players are dealt two cards initially and can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards or "stand" to keep their current hand. Aces can be counted as 1 or 11, and face cards have a value of 10. The game involves strategic decision-making and a duel against a dealer, with the goal of outscoring them without going over 21.
